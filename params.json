{"name":"GOsummaries","tagline":"Concise visualizations of Gene Ontology enrichment results","body":"GOsummaries\r\n===========\r\n\r\nAn R package that visualizes the GO enrichment results as word clouds and arranges them together with figures of experimental data. This allows us to draw informative summary plots for analyses such as differential expression or clustering, where for each gene list we display its behaviour in the experiment alongside with its GO annotations. The approach is especially interesting for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where we can annotate the principal axes functionally based on the weights of the genes.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThe package is available ar CRAN, so the installation can be done as usual. \r\n```s\r\ninstall.packages(\"GOsummaries\")`\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore comprehensive user guide can be found in the [vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GOsummaries/vignettes/GOsummaries-basics.pdf).\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### PCA \r\n```s\r\n# Perform PCA on samples\r\npcr = prcomp(t(tissue_example$exp))\r\n\r\n# Create gosummaries object\r\ngs_pca = gosummaries(pcr, annotation = tissue_example$annot)\r\n\r\n# Plot\r\nplot(gs_pca, classes = \"Tissue\")\r\n```\r\n![pca](http://raivokolde.github.com/GOsummaries/images/pca.png)\r\n\r\n### K-means clustering\r\n```s\r\nlibrary(GOsummaries)\r\n\r\ndata(tissue_example)\r\n\r\n# Filter genes and perform k-means\r\nsd = apply(tissue_example$exp, 1, sd)\r\nexp2 = tissue_example$exp[sd > 0.75,]\r\nexp2 = exp2 - apply(exp2, 1, mean)\r\nkmr = kmeans(exp2, centers = 6, iter.max = 100)\r\n\r\n# Create gosummaries object\r\ngs_kmeans = gosummaries(kmr, exp = exp2, annotation = tissue_example$annot)\r\nplot(gs_kmeans, components = 1:2)\r\n```\r\n![kmeans](http://raivokolde.github.com/GOsummaries/images/kmeans.png)","google":"UA-39808888-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
